# LabyrinthFile

## I made this project in Programming 2 Interface and persistence

This project reads a text file labyrinth and converts the data characters to images, displaying a labyrinth

This is the laberynth in text file mode:

*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*
*,*,*,0,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*
?,0,*,0,0,*,*,*,*,0,0,0,*,*,*,*
*,0,*,*,0,*,*,*,0,0,*,0,0,0,0,*
*,0,0,0,0,*,*,0,0,*,*,*,*,*,0,*
*,*,*,*,0,0,0,0,*,*,*,*,*,0,0,*
*,0,0,0,0,*,*,*,*,*,0,0,0,*,*,*
*,0,*,*,*,*,0,0,0,*,0,*,0,0,*,*
*,0,0,0,0,0,0,*,0,0,0,*,*,0,*,*
*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,+,*,*

Each character symbolizes something :
 * symbolizes the blocks or walls  🧇
 0 the zero symbolizes the way out of the labyrinth 0️⃣
 ? symbolizes the person into the labyrinth 👩🏼
 + Symbolizes the end of the labyrinth (a heart) 💖
